    "text": "For the modelling section of the project, keras was used for the training, tuning and testing. keras is an open-source python library that allows users to to build Neural Networks. It is known for modularity and it’s relatively gentle learning curve compared to other libraries such as pytorch. The modularity makes keras a good library for projects requiring lots of experimentation such as this one. It should be noted that when working with keras in R, all the functions used are wrapper functions of the native python functions. This makes version control extremely important. For this project, the models were created, trained and tuned using R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) and python version 3.11.6.\nThe goal for this project was to train a neural network to predict the forecasted avalanche hazard(FAH). Since we are predicting the forecast, the observed avalanche hazard(OAH) needs to be removed otherwise the model would be trained on information that would not be available on new data, i.e, data leakage. Therefore the predictor sets are explicitly defined so that there is no data leakage.\nA 70/30 training split was used in the data. Usually we would set aside a small portion for validation but as we will see later, keras handles this for us so we do not need to specify a validation set. Using a seed for this step is important as it ensures the split remains every time the code is ran. This is the first step toward achieving repeatable results.\n\n\n\nComparison of percentage of each category in the training and test sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncategory 0\ncategory 1\ncategory 2\ncategory 3\ncategory 4\n\n\n\n\ntrain\n0.328\n0.303\n0.236\n0.088\n0.044\n\n\ntest\n0.320\n0.312\n0.236\n0.089\n0.043\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table above reports the percentage of each category of FAH that is in the training and test data. It is important that the percentages are approximately equal in both sets and indeed this is the case. This is good but there is a problem. For the best results there should be approximately the same number of observations from each category in both the training and test sets, which is not the case for this data. Category 0 and 1 both are roughly the same at roughly 30% of total observations each. Category 2 is slightly lower with 23% but category 3 and 4 are hugely unrepresented in the data with only 9% and 4% respectively. This is an issue because big imbalances such as this will cause the model to optimise for correctly identifying observations from categories 0, 1 and 2.\nThere a few possible methods we can use to mitigate this issue but the method chosen for this project was to define custom class weights so that incorrect predictions have different penalties for each category. The idea is that underrepresented categories have higher weights so that in the training the model gets penalised more heavily and hopefully the final model is better at making predictions for the underpresented categories. The weights chosen were inversely proportional to the percentage of appearance in the training data. A possible area of further experimentation is using bootstrap sampling to equalise the percentages of each category.\nFor this project there were 4 predictor sets that were evaluated. Predictor set 1 contained variables relating to the location of the observation. Predictor set 2 contained variables relating to the weather conditions of the observation. Predictor set 3 contained variables relating to a snow pack test. Predictor set 4 contained all the varibles in the dataset and thus contained all three predictor sets inside it. The final model will be built using all the available data, so predictor set 4. The remaining three predictor sets serve as yardstick to which we can compare which sets of variables are important."

To find the optimal value for these hyperparameters we do hyperparameter tuning. In order to do this in R we need to use the kerastuneR library.

    "text": "Hyperparameter tuning\nkerastuneR has multiple tuning algorithms, we have used the RandomSearch algorithm. RandomSearch takes random combinations of the provided hyperparameters and fits the model each time. Since the combination of hyperparameters is random, there is a possibility that the same mode configuration is ran multiple times by the algorithm. The algorithm does attempt to mitigate this but it not guaranteed to stop duplicate runs. We do have some control over this though by setting the max_trials variable to the total number of unique models that can be specified from our selected tuning ranges. It has also been specified that each model should be fit 3 times by setting executions_per_trial = 3. This reduces variation in the results since there is an element of randomness in the initialisation of the model. A validation split of 20% was used and shuffle = T was used. Doing this shuffles the which observations get used as the validation set. This helps reduce the chances of overfitting.\nAll the results from tuning were saved into folders so that the results can be extracted and used for further analysis. The tuning was was undertaken is by no means exhaustive, no tuning can ever be, but the range of values tuned over is relatively small and therefore the results should be taken with a pinch of salt. With more time and perhaps more compute power a better result is possible."

The sensitivity for class 0 is the best with a value of 0,854. There is a steep drop off for the other classes but class 2 is the second highest with a value of 0,557 and the rest are all below 0.5 meaning that more often than not, the model is unable to identify the correct category. An analogy for sensitivity is a test with high sensitivity(close to the maximum of 1) will identify most of the patients with with the flu as having the flu but this may mean that lots of patients without the flu also get identified as having the flu. An extreme case may be if the model predicted all observations as belonging to category 0. Then the sensitivity would be 1,meaning that all observations that belong to category 0 are predicted to be category 0. So there need to be a balance because we do not want this\nSpecificity gives the percent of time the an observation does not belong to a specific category and the model predicts it as not belonging to that category. High specificity(close to the maximum of 1) is analogous to a test rarely every flagging someone as having the flu when they don’t. A perfect model will have high sensitivity with a high specificity, meaning that it is able to identify when observations belong to a category and does not incorrectly predict other observations as belonging to that category. The table above indicates that all the categories have relatively high specificity. Class 4 has a specificity of 0.996 which on the surface looks great but because the sensitivity is so low, this high specificity just means that the model rarely every predicts any observations as belonging to category 4. The same follows for category 3. This is also seen in the extremely low detection rate and prevalence for these categories. These results, specifically for categories 3 and 4 are an indication that perhaps just reweighting the classes was not enough to overcome the imbalance in the data.\nA better metric for instances such as this where the data is imbalanced is the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. The precision is the percentage of observations that belonged to a category and were correctly predicted as belonging to that category. The recall is just the sensitivity. The F1 score, same as the other metrics, ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 being the worst and 1 being the best. The F1 score is useful because the harmonic mean because it is less affected by extreme values than the arithmetic mean. Categories 4 and 3 are by far the worst with values of 0,104 and 0,119. Category 0 has the best F1 score with a value of 0,716. Then category 1 has a value of 0,383 and category 3 has a score of 0,487. All these values, except for category are quite poor and indicate lack of predictive power. This is reflected in the fact that the model achieved an accuracy of 51,7% on the test set. The model is better than blindly guessing which we expect to return an accuracy of 20% but the model lacks predictive power. Expanding the search are for tuning as well as utalising bootstrapping may yield better results."

This is an issue because big imbalances such as this will cause the model to optimise for correctly identifying observations from categories 0, 1 and 2.\nThere a few possible methods we can use to mitigate this issue but the method chosen for this project was to define custom class weights so that incorrect predictions have different penalties for each category. The idea is that underrepresented categories have higher weights so that in the training the model gets penalised more heavily and hopefully the final model is better at making predictions for the underpresented categories. The weights chosen were inversely proportional to the percentage of appearance in the training data. A possible area of further experimentation is using bootstrap sampling to equalise the percentages of each category.\nFor this project there were 4 predictor sets that were evaluated. Predictor set 1 contained variables relating to the location of the observation. Predictor set 2 contained variables relating to the weather conditions of the observation. Predictor set 3 contained variables relating to a snow pack test. Predictor set 4 contained all the varibles in the dataset and thus contained all three predictor sets inside it. The final model will be built using all the available data, so predictor set 4. The remaining three predictor sets serve as yardstick to which we can compare which sets of variables are important."
