## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for Assignment 1 of the STA5073Z - Data Science for Industry 2025 course at the University of Cape Town.

The goal of this project is to construct and evaluate a neural network model that predicts the **Forecasted Avalanche Hazard (FAH)**, as published by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS). We utilize a 15-year archive of avalanche forecasts, combining data on topography, weather conditions, and snow pack integrity.

- **Problem:** Multi-class classification (ordinal)
- **Target Variable:** `FAH` (Forecasted Avalanche Hazard)
- **Key Predictors:** Topography, Weather, Snow Pack Test results
- **Model:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras

**Live Website:** https://saadz97.github.io/DS4I_ASSIGNMENT_1/   
**Final Report:** https://github.com/saadz97/DS4I_ASSIGNMENT_1/tree/main/Final%20Submission%20Files

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

- **Weather variables are most predictive**: Predictor Set 2 (weather conditions) achieved the highest validation accuracy (66%), slightly outperforming the comprehensive feature set
- **Optimal architecture**: 4 hidden layers with [30, 40, 40, 40] nodes provided the best balance of performance and complexity  
- **Class imbalance challenge**: Model excels at predicting Low hazard (85% sensitivity) but struggles with High hazard categories (6% sensitivity)
- **Overall performance**: 51.7% test accuracy, significantly better than random guessing (20%) but limited by severe class imbalance
- **Feature importance**: Weather data dominates predictive power, with topographic and snow-pack variables providing marginal incremental value
- **Practical implication**: Neural networks show promise as decision support tools but require human oversight, especially for high-consequence hazard levels

**Best Model**: 64.9% validation accuracy using all available predictors with careful hyperparameter optimization.
