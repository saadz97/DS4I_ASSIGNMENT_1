Data and Methods\nThe dataset used in this study consists of daily avalanche forecasts for six forecasting regions across Scotland (Creag Meagaidh, Glencoe, Lochaber, Northern Cairngorms, Southern Cairngorms, and Torridon), collected by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) between 2009 and 2025. It contains 10,671 observations and 34 variables including weather conditions, topography, snowpack properties, and avalanche hazard levels.\nThe target variable for this project is the Forecast Avalanche Hazard (FAH), a categorical variable with five ordered levels: Low, Moderate, Considerable -, Considerable +, and High."

Initially, rows with missing FAH values (109 rows) were removed, and FAH levels were replaced with a numerical representation from 0 to 4 for compatibility with the neural network software. Other categorical variables, such as precipitation type and forecast region, were similarly transformed into numerical formats.

Cloud cover was limited to 0–100%, total snow depth to 0–1,500 cm (with unrealistic spikes removed), and foot penetration depth to 100 cm. Snow temperatures above 0.5 °C were flagged as implausible, since snow begins melting at 0 °C, and maximum temperature gradients were limited to below 25 °C per 10 cm (…). Observations where foot penetration exceeded total snow depth were also removed.\nCircular variables such as wind direction and aspect were transformed into sine and cosine components.\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) was then performed to assess variable distributions, relationships with FAH, multicollinearity, and seasonal and geographic trends using correlation heatmaps, histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots.\n\n2.2 Neural Network Stuff…\n…."
