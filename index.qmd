## Project Overview

This website presents the work for **Assignment 1** of the STA5073Z - Data Science for Industry 2025 course at the University of Cape Town.

Our project focuses on constructing and evaluating a neural network model to predict the **Forecasted Avalanche Hazard (FAH)** using a 15-year archive of data from the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS). By combining topographic, meteorological, and snow pack test data, we aim to model the complex decision-making process of expert avalanche forecasters.

## Project Deliverables
